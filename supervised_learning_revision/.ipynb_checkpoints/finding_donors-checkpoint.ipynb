    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",

    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "The Naive Bayes model performs well with the underlying assumption that the features/factors are independent of each other.

Since these models tend to perform very well when it comes to identifying boundaries, use-cases such as defect-detection, outlier detection (on imbalanced datasets) etc are widely seen. The strenghts of the model stemms for the fact that multiple decision trees are aggregated to give the best average model. This allows for various model adjustments (such as weights adjustment etc) to occur on the fly. The weakness of the model is most often the fact that these are very prone to overfitting. Since the current use case falls in the category of imbalanced datasets classification, it would be a perfect choice for ensemble methods used to model. <br>\n",
    "** Support Vector Machines ** <br>\n",
    "Support Vector Machines are currently being used widely for face-detection, textual categorization, image classifcation etc where multi-level classification becomes important. The strenght of this model stems from the fact that we can transform/extrapolate the features to higher dimensions thus allowing for better/finer classification. The weakness of SVMs is that the choice of kernels varies a lot and given a wide variety of choices, hyperparameter tuning gets intense and involved. A lot of time, effort and iterations are used up to find the perfect fit of the hyperparameters. Thinking about the current dataset, while SVMs might not be the best fit, I would like to look at the possibilties of any good boundaries in multiple dimensions. SVMs for the model would be more of an exploratory attempt"

    "**Answer: Based on the three models chosen for the analysis, the ensemble methods (AdaBoost Classifier) tends to be performing better. The conclusion can be reached upon by taking three parameters into consideration (on which each of the three models were marked). The prediction/training time for the SVC classifier tends to be the highest and considerable by a great margin compared to Naive-bayes and Adaboost. Comparing the Accuracy and the F_0.5(since precision is of importance here) score the Adaboost model outperforms the other two on both the training and the testing datasets (even while taking multiple subsets of the datasets). This analysis gives us a preliminary idea on which one model to finetune (the hyperparameters) to result in the best prediction for the dataset in hand  **"

    "**Answer: <br> The final model being proposed is a derivative of the binary tree model. The binary tree model is probably one of the most intuitive models out there to be understood. It can be thought of as a model built out of selection of choices (thought of as a bunch of yes/no choices). For a layman's understanding, the model iteratively asks questions such as 'whether the person is educated or not? whether the person works for the govt. or in private sector and many such questions to come to a final conclusion whether the person (of interest) might earn above 50K or not. <br> <br>Multiple such binary trees (which are now termed as decision trees since they help us decide on the final outcome) are prepared and a weighted average (ie. averaged inequally) of all the multiple binary trees is taken as the final model that can help predict whether a person (given information about income,education etc) will be probably to make higher than 50K annually and thus potential being a worthy candidate for a donor. The underlying assumption here is that all the members of the population who earn more than 50K annually will be most likely to pour in donations for a noble cause. Going into a little bit of the technical details, the model is fine-tuned based on all the past-historic data collected to create the decision boundary for the binary trees. The choice questions are then posed onto any new dataset(prediction on the new dataset) and then based on the choices and averaging, eventual decision(whether to classify as income>50K or <= 50K) is arrived at.   ** "

    "**Answer: Three out of the five features mentioned previously have been proved to be correct from the model's perspective. Features such as hours-per-week and age tend to be more important over occupation and work-class. I am a little surprised with the model's finding considering that the dataset is from year 1994 and during that time(as far as I can recollect) the occupation was a huge deciding factor towards one's income levels. I think through this modelling exercise, it has become evident that in a state like california, the kind of occupation and the class of work one does does not give as much indication towards the income levels; rather what tends to matter more is the age and the amount of hours(per week) one puts in their work**"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer: Using a reduced dataset (of only 5 features over 13) for model training and performance comparision, it empirically shows that both the accuracy and the F(0.5) score are impacted only at the second-decimal point. Whether this is acceptable or not depends on the final-end users of the model. Taking into consideration the current-use case of predicting donor, I would argue that the difference is minor and can be done with. If training time was a factor while choosing multiple models, I would highly consider reducing the data (as the training set). This would improve the model performace time along with very minor loss of accuracy and precision. The trade-off would be worth it considering the given use-case. This might not always be true in other real world applications where minor improvements on accruacy/F_score might be of high importance over performance time**"
